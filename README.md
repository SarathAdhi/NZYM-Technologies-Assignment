    It should show the personâ€™s image. You may display the personâ€™s credentials if
    the person's image is unavailable. i.e. first letters of the first name and last name.
  - Id: refers to person id
  - First Name: person first name
  - Last Name: person last name

- ðŸ”¼ Marked columns will be sortable alphabetically or numerically depending on the
  column type. The sort button should toggle between ascending and descending when
  clicked.
- The drop-down for the Number of rows, should have options -- 10, 15, 30, 50.
  On choosing the number, the number of table rows should update accordingly.
- Each row should be clickable. Clicking the row, should expand within the table and show
  the Personâ€™s complete address.
